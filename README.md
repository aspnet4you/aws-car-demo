AWS Cross Account Lambda execution using Cross Account Role (CAR) with least privilege

Be sure to replace the source/destination account number in the parameter.

For the purpose of learning, I used Former2 tool to script the CloudFormation from existing resources and modified it to support parameters. Former2 requires that you provide IAM key and secret. It's okay to share them just for demo account but I would not use it for production. More info on Former2- https://former2.com
